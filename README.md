https://github.com/xianminx/mcp-server-flomo

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets you create notes in Flomo directly through AI chat interactions in Cursor or Claude desktop. Write and organize your thoughts seamlessly through natural language commands.

## Usage

Configure Claude / Cursor / Windsurf / Cline / ChatWise / Cherry Studio etc.

```bash
FLOMO_API_URL=your_api_url_here npx -y mcp-server-flomo
```

Or configure for your MCP Host / Client. See https://mcp.so/server/mcp-server-flomo for configuration detail.

Get your Flomo API URL from [Flomo API Settings](https://v.flomoapp.com/mine)

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-flomo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-server-flomo"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FLOMO_API_URL": "your_api_url_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once the server is running, you can create notes in Flomo through natural language commands in your AI chat. Here are some examples:

```json
"How to publish a mcp server? Could you save the answer to flomo note after answering it"
```

The server will handle:

- Converting your natural language requests into Flomo API calls
